# D3 Workshop NYCDA Dec 2018

Introduction to D3 workshop for NYCDA alumni in the Winter of 2018.

Let's learn D3 development, two basic notions from statistics, and naive set theory by visualizing the sample space for rolling two dice.

This workshop is based off the reading of sections 2 & 3 found in `ss-and-events.pdf` in this repository, drawn from *Introduction to Mathematical Statistics* by Paul G. Hoel, 1971.

To include:

* function to return random outputs that represent the rolls of two dice
* visualization of a two-dimensional sample space
* mapping of dice roll results to points in the sample space

Definition of sample space:

  The set of points representing the possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space of the experiment.

Definition of event:

  An event is a subset of a sample space.

NEXT STEPS:

* alternatively represent the points of the sample space as a table of numbers
* map other events to the sample space, i.e. all rolls that sum to even numbers or all rolls with one even and one odd number
