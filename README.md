# D3 Workshop NYCDA Dec 2018

Introduction to D3 workshop for NYCDA alumni in the Winter of 2018.

Let's learn D3 development, two basic notions from statistics, and naive set theory by visualizing the sample space for rolling two dice.

To include:

* function to return random outputs that represent the rolls of two dice
* visualization of a two-dimensional sample space
* mapping of dice roll results to points in the sample space
* alternatively represent the points of the sample space as a table of numbers
* alternatively represent dice roll results with flubber

Definition of sample space:

  The set of points representing the possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space of the experiment.

Definition of event:

  An event is a subset of a sample space.
